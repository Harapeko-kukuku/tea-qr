<h1>Sencha</h1>

<p>
999 Sencha is a delicate blend of high-quality tea leaves.<br>
Brewing carefully brings out its natural sweetness and umami.<br>
Here is the basic brewing method.
</p>

<h2>■ Prepare the water</h2>
<p>
Sencha is best brewed at a slightly lower temperature.<br>
Prepare water at about 60–70°C.<br>
Tip: pour boiling water into a cup and let it cool for about 1 minute.
</p>

<h2>■ Tea leaves</h2>
<p>
Use about 3g per serving (around 1 teaspoon).
</p>

<h2>■ Pour the water</h2>
<p>
Pour the cooled water into the teapot (about 30ml per serving).
</p>

<h2>■ Steep</h2>
<p>
Wait about 1 to 1.5 minutes.<br>
During this time the leaves slowly release their umami.
</p>

<h2>■ Pouring</h2>
<p>
Pour every last drop evenly.
</p>

<h2>■ Second & third infusion</h2>
<p>
• 2nd: about 70°C / about 30 seconds<br>
• 3rd: boiling water / 1 second<br>
Each infusion offers a different taste.
</p>

<h2>■ Enjoy the leaves</h2>
<p>
After brewing, the leaves can also be eaten as “ohitashi”<br>
with a little soy sauce or ponzu.
</p>

<p>
Enjoy a calm and relaxing tea moment.
