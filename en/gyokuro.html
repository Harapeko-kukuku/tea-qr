    <h1>Gyokuro</h1>

    <p>
      Gyokuro is a delicate, high-quality green tea.<br>
      When brewed carefully, it brings out deep umami and sweetness.<br>
      Below is a simple guide for the best cup.
    </p>

    <h2>■ Prepare the water</h2>
    <p>
      Gyokuro tastes best brewed at a low temperature.<br>
      Prepare water at about 40–50°C.<br>
      Tip: pour boiling water into a cup and wait about 1 minute to cool.
    </p>

    <h2>■ Tea leaves</h2>
    <p>
      Use about 3g per serving (around 1 teaspoon) in a teapot.
    </p>

    <h2>■ Pour the water</h2>
    <p>
      Pour the cooled water (about 30ml per serving).
    </p>

    <h2>■ Steep</h2>
    <p>
      Wait about 2 to 2.5 minutes.<br>
      The leaves will slowly release umami during this time.
    </p>

    <h2>■ How to pour</h2>
    <p>
      Pour out every last drop.
    </p>

    <h2>■ Second & third infusion</h2>
    <p>
      • 2nd: about 70°C / about 30 seconds<br>
      • 3rd: boiling water / 1 second<br>
      Each infusion has a different character.
    </p>

    <h2>■ Enjoy the leaves</h2>
    <p>
      After brewing, the leaves can be enjoyed as “ohitashi.”<br>
      Add a little soy sauce or ponzu and eat them as a small snack.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enjoy your slow tea time.
